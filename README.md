# uqac-bdd-healing

During the following course, 8INF803 Bases de données réparties at [Uqac](https://uqac.ca) on trimester "Automne 2019", we had to build an interface for searching spell.
The data are gathered by scraping using python and both cleaned and reorganized using spark.

The front-end service is powered by a meteor framerwork ([installation link here](https://www.meteor.com/install)) you can run by using the following command : 
```shell
meteor npm start
```
and then go to your navigator on this [link](http://localhost:3000)

*If this is the first launch on your machine, you need to fullfill your mongoDB database with the rdd provided by spark.*
*Will be updated with the spark script..*
